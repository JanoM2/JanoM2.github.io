ðŸš€ Technologies Used


I chose a classic and pure approach, without using frameworks or additional libraries, so for this portfolio, I used the following technologies:

HTML5 and CSS3: For the structure and styling foundation.  
JavaScript: For interactivity and functionality.  
Git: For version control and GitHub Pages for publishing the portfolio directly from GitHub.  


Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and seeing how Iâ€™ve applied my skills across different developments.
